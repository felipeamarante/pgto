Nice way to piss off the ower.

Deploy instructions

Clone the repository
pip install -r requeriments.txt
python app.py


Usage instructions
The app uses url building and routing to manipulate the layout... So it will be for eg:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/nameOftheOwer/500
Where:                 name/\       /\ money

Simple and funny,


Docker also available for latte guys.
